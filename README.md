About 42 School 


42 is free code school originally founded in Paris by Xavier Niel (who some call the French Steve Jobs). It’s not just a free school though, it’s a hands-on project-based approach using peer learning as it’s primary teaching method.
It’s highly competitive and its cadets (students) are some of the most sought after in the industry.
